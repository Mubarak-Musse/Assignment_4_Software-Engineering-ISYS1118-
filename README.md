`CLO 1: explain how iterative software engineering processes can facilitate software development
CLO 2: evaluate requirements for a software system
CLO 5: communicate effectively with others, especially regarding the progress of the system development and the content of the design by means of reports and presentations. Use appropriate design, `version control and collaboration tools to work effectively as a team.
CLO 6: recognise and describe current trends in the area of software engineering. CLO 7: Design and carry out tests using various testing techniques and tools.

2. Overview of Assessment
This assignment will assess your ability in terms of writing quality unit tests, test cases, user stories, and acceptance tests, as well as working with GitHub and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. You will be asked to implement and test some small functions in the
 
 DigtialID platform. Then you need to move your source code to GitHub. Also, you need to show that the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered to automatically run the Unit tests once code is pushed to GitHub. Furthermore, following the templates and structures taught in the lectures, you must write eight user stories for the DigtialID platform, along with their acceptance criteria. Finally, you need to make a video of your Java program.

3. Assessment Activities
General Description
Based on the requirements of the DigtialID platform, you need to do the following activities for the DigtialID platform.

Activities in Assessment 4
Activity 1: Git/GitHub/GitHub Actions and Unit Test + a Video of your program (17 points): In the DigtialID platform, there is a class called Person. The Person class has three functions called "addPerson", "updatePersonalDetails" and "addID". You are asked to implement and test these three functions. The Person class has the following methods and attributes.
   
Important Note: The code written below is just a placeholder. You are allowed to edit it and add new functions (e.g., add getter and setter, new constructors, etc.), new attributes, new classes, etc. You are completely FREE on how you want to implement and test these functions. The key point is to write enough test cases to test the conditions discussed below. You are free to consider any other conditions.
